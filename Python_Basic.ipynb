        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to read and write. It uses simple English-like syntax, so beginners can learn it quickly\n",
        "\n",
        "    It is popular because:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1) It is easy to learn and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2) It has a large number of libraries for AI, data science, and web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3) It has a big community that helps solve problems easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs the Python code line by line.\n",
        "    It converts each line of code into machine language so the computer can understand it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->\tPre-defined keywords in Python are special reserved words that have a specific meaning and purpose in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->\tNo, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ->\tMutability means whether a data object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -If an object is mutable, we can change its contents without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -If it is immutable, its contents cannot be changed once it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> \tLists are mutable because we can change, add, or remove their elements after creating them.\n",
        "    Python stores lists in a way that allows modification of their contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Tuples are immutable because their elements cannot be changed once they are created. Python fixes the memory for a tuple, so it becomes faster and more secure for data that should not change.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> “==” checks if the values of two objects are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "    “is” checks if both variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -> Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "    They return either True or False based on the conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "    There are three logical operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "    **and** → True only if both conditions are True\n",
        "\n",
        "    **or**→ True if at least one condition is True\n",
        "\n",
        "    **not** → reverses the result (True becomes False, and vice versa)\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     ->\tType casting in Python means converting one data type into another.\n",
        "\n",
        "      For example, we can change a string into an integer or a float.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Python provides built-in functions for this, like **int()**, **float()**, **str()**, and **bool()**.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "     ->\tImplicit type casting happens automatically by Python.\n",
        "     Python converts one data type to another without the programmer writing code for it.\n",
        "\n",
        "     -Explicit type casting is done manually using functions like **int(), float(), or str().**\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     -> Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "     They let the program choose different actions based on whether a condition is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "     ->\tThe elif statement in Python means \"else if\".\n",
        "\n",
        "     It allows you to check multiple conditions, one after another.\n",
        "     If one condition is True, Python runs that block and skips the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is the difference between for and while loops in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     ->\tA for loop runs a fixed number of times.\n",
        "      It is used when we know how many times we want to repeat something.\n",
        "      A while loop runs as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "      It is used when we don’t know exactly how many times the loop should run.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "     -> A while loop is better when we don’t know how many times the loop needs to run.\n",
        "     It keeps running until a certain condition becomes False.\n",
